# Awesome Dotfiles

Fundamentally changed version of [Parth/dotfiles](https://github.com/Parth/dotfiles).

## Installation

Once the repo is cloned, execute the deploy script:

```shell
./deploy
```

This script guides you through the following:

1. Checks to see if you have zsh, tmux, and vim installed.
2. Installs them using your default package manager if you don't have some of them installed.
3. Checks to see if your default shell is zsh.
4. Sets zsh to your default shell.
5. Backs up your old configuration files.

Pretty convenient for configuring new servers.
